    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *User Input*: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI models are being developed to predict whether a newly identified target is \"druggable\" – meaning whether it's possible to design a molecule that can effectively interact with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Accelerating Pre-clinical Stages:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **In Silico Screening:** AI can perform virtual screening of millions of potential drug compounds against targets much faster and cheaper than traditional high-throughput screening (HTS).\n",
      "*   **Predicting ADMET Properties:** AI models are getting better at predicting Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties of drug candidates. This helps filter out compounds likely to fail later in development due to poor pharmacokinetics or toxicity.\n",
      "*   **Automated Experiment Design:** AI can assist in designing and optimizing pre-clinical experiments, reducing trial-and-error and saving resources.\n",
      "\n",

      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Okay, let's dive deeper into the **second development** I mentioned in the context of AI in drug discovery:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Enhanced Target Identification and Validation**\n",
      "\n",
      "This area focuses on using AI to figure out *what biological targets* within the body are most relevant to a disease and *whether those targets are good candidates* for drug intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of what this entails and why it's significant:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is a Biological Target?**\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of drug discovery, a biological target is typically a molecule (often a protein, enzyme, or receptor) within the body that plays a crucial role in a disease process. By designing a drug that interacts with this target (either activating it, inhibiting it, or modifying its function), scientists aim to alter the course of the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is Target Identification and Validation Difficult?**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Complexity of Biology:** The human body is incredibly complex, with intricate networks of interacting molecules. Identifying the *primary* drivers of a disease, rather than just downstream effects, is challenging.\n",
      "*   **Vast Amounts of Data:** Modern biology generates massive datasets from various sources (genomics, proteomics, etc.). Manually sifting through this data to find meaningful patterns is nearly impossible.\n",
      "*   **\"Undruggable\" Targets:** Even if a target is identified, it might be difficult to design a drug that can effectively and safely interact with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification and Validation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **AI for \"Omics\" Data Analysis:**\n",
      "    *   **What it is:** \"Omics\" refers to fields like genomics (studying genes), proteomics (studying proteins), transcriptomics (studying RNA), and metabolomics (studying metabolites). These fields generate vast amounts of data about the molecular makeup of cells and tissues.\n",
      "    *   **AI's Role:** AI algorithms excel at finding patterns, correlations, and anomalies within these massive datasets. They can:\n",
      "        *   Identify **genes or proteins that are abnormally expressed** in diseased tissues compared to healthy ones.\n",
      "        *   Pinpoint **mutations** in genes that are strongly linked to disease development.\n",
      "        *   Discover **biomarkers** that indicate the presence or progression of a disease.\n",
      "        *   **Integrate data** from different \"omics\" layers to get a more holistic understanding of disease mechanisms.\n",
      "    *   **Significance:** This allows researchers to move beyond educated guesses and identify potential targets based on robust data-driven insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Network Biology and Pathway Analysis:**\n",
      "    *   **What it is:** Biological processes don't happen in isolation; they occur within complex networks and pathways. For example, a signal might be triggered by one protein, then passed to another, leading to a cellular response.\n",
      "    *   **AI's Role:** AI can model these intricate biological networks. It can identify:\n",
      "        *   **Key \"hub\" proteins** or molecules that have a central role in a disease pathway.\n",
      "        *   **Bottlenecks or critical control points** in signaling cascades that, if modulated, could have a significant therapeutic effect.\n",
      "        *   **Off-target effects** that might arise from interfering with a particular pathway.\n",
      "    *   **Significance:** Understanding the broader biological context helps ensure that targeting a specific molecule will have the desired therapeutic outcome and minimize unintended consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Predicting Target \"Druggability\":**\n",
      "    *   **What it is:** Not all biological targets are created equal when it comes to drug development. Some have binding pockets that are well-suited for small molecules or antibodies, while others are not.\n",
      "    *   **AI's Role:** AI models can be trained on data from successful and failed drug development programs to predict:\n",
      "        *   The **likelihood that a given target can be modulated** by a drug.\n",
      "        *   The **ideal type of drug modality** (e.g., small molecule, antibody, gene therapy) for a specific target.\n",
      "        *   Potential **challenges in developing a drug** for that target.\n",
      "    *   **Significance:** This prevents researchers from investing vast time and resources into developing drugs for targets that are inherently very difficult or impossible to drug, thus improving the efficiency of the R&D pipeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impact:**\n",
      "\n",
      "By enhancing target identification and validation, AI:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Reduces the time and cost** associated with the early stages of drug discovery.\n",
      "*   **Increases the probability of success** by focusing on more relevant and druggable targets.\n",
      "*   **Uncovers novel therapeutic strategies** that might not have been discovered through traditional methods.\n",
      "*   **Enables the development of treatments** for diseases that were previously considered \"undruggable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This development is foundational because without identifying the right target, even the most sophisticated drug design capabilities will be ineffective. AI provides the computational power and pattern recognition abilities to navigate the immense complexity of human biology and pinpoint the most promising avenues for therapeutic intervention.\n",

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n",
